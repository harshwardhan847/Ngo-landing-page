While providing shelter to all those in need might not always be possible, we extend our support by distributing 1,000 nutritious meals every month to individuals living on the streets, in temporary huts, or in vulnerable conditions. For many, a meal isn't just foodâ€”it's hope, strength, and the assurance that someone cares.",
